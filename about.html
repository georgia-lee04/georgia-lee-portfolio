              After completing my Master of Science in Psychology, I began my
              career in PR and Events in August 2023, where I worked for just
              over a year. While I enjoyed the creativity and fast-paced nature
              of the industry, I found myself increasingly drawn to
              problem-solving, technology, and building things from
              scratchâ€”leading me to coding.
              <br />
              While my path into coding may be slightly unconventional, my
              experience in PR and background in History and Psychology bring a
              unique perspective to problem-solving in tech. I love that coding
              offers endless opportunities to learn and grow, and Iâ€™m especially
              interested in Front-End Development and UX/UI Development.
              <br />
              A few months ago, I took the leap into front-end development
              through the SheCodes Bootcamp Course, where Iâ€™ve gained hands-on
              experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, with React as my
              next focus.

      Coding combines my creativity, analytical thinking, and user experience
      skills in an entirely new way, and I love the challenge it brings. I'm on
      track to complete the full course by the end of March. ðŸŒŸTech Skills: âœ”
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6), Bootstrap, Python, VS Code âœ” API Integration,
      Responsive Design, Hosting âœ” Git/GitHub, Netlify âœ” Data Manipulation &
      Visualization, OOP, File Manipulation âœ” Currently learning React and more
      advanced Responsive Design techniques Transitioning into tech has been
      both challenging and rewarding, and Iâ€™m excited to keep growing as a
      developer. ðŸ‘‰Iâ€™m currently open to opportunities in front-end development
      and junior developer roles. I'm eager to bring my skills into a tech role
      where I can continue learning and growing. For those who have also made
      the transition into tech, Iâ€™d love to hear your advice for someone just
      starting out. It would be great to hear your experiences, and connect!
